# ArenaHard-EU Dataset Card

## Dataset Description

ArenaHard-EU is a comprehensive multilingual benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) across 35 European and neighboring languages. This dataset extends the original Arena-Hard benchmark through machine translation, enabling robust multilingual LLM evaluation.

### Key Features

- **35 Languages**: Covers all official EU languages plus co-official languages, candidate member languages, and Scandinavian languages
- **500+ Prompts per Language**: Challenging instructions spanning diverse topics and complexities
- **Consistent Structure**: Maintains the original Arena-Hard format for easy integration with existing evaluation pipelines

A similar dataset is [m-ArenaHard](https://huggingface.co/datasets/CohereLabs/m-ArenaHard) which contains 23 languages translated with google-translate.

## Supported Languages

The dataset includes the following 35 languages (ISO 639-3 codes in parentheses):

**Official EU Languages:**
Bulgarian (bul), Croatian (hrv), Czech (ces), Danish (dan), Dutch (nld), Estonian (est), Finnish (fin), French (fra), German (deu), Greek (ell), Hungarian (hun), Irish (gle), Italian (ita), Latvian (lav), Lithuanian (lit), Maltese (mlt), Polish (pol), Portuguese (por), Romanian (ron), Slovak (slk), Slovene (slv), Spanish (spa), Swedish (swe)

**Co-official & Regional Languages:**
Basque (eus), Catalan (cat), Galician (glg)

**Candidate & Neighboring Countries:**
Albanian (sqi), Bosnian (bos), Georgian (kat), Icelandic (isl), Macedonian (mkd), Norwegian (nor), Serbian (srp), Turkish (tur), Ukrainian (ukr)

## Usage

### Loading the Dataset
```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load a specific language subset
dataset = load_dataset("openeurollm/ArenaHard-EU", "fra")  # French

# Access the data
for example in dataset["train"]:
    print(example["prompt"])
```

### Using with OpenJury for Model Evaluation

**TODO coming soon**

Evaluate and compare two models using the OpenJury framework:
```bash
python openjury/generate_and_evaluate.py \
  --dataset arena-hard-EU \
  --model_A gpt4_1106_preview \
  --model_B VLLM/utter-project/EuroLLM-9B \
  --judge_model OpenRouter/deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1 \
  --language fra \
  --n_instructions 100
```

## Dataset Structure

### Data Fields

Each example contains the following fields:

- `question_id` (string): Unique identifier for the example
- `cluster` (string): Thematic category/topic of the instruction
- `category` (string): Source dataset from the original Arena-Hard compilation
- `prompt` (string): The instruction or question text in the target language
- `lang` (string): ISO 639-3 language code

### Example
```json
{
  "question_id": "0001",
  "cluster": "coding",
  "category": "arena-hard",
  "prompt": "Écrivez une fonction Python qui calcule la suite de Fibonacci.",
  "lang": "fra"
}
```
